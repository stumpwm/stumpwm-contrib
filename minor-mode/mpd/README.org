** Usage
Put:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
    (load-module "mpd")
#+END_SRC
into your =~/.stumpwmrc=

Then you can use "%m" in your mode line format, as well as various commands
defined at the end of the file.

You can customize the modeline format (*mpd-modeline-fmt*), the status
message displayed by the command mpd-status (*mpd-status-fmt*; note that
this is also used on the modeline), and the status message displayed by the

*mpd-modeline-fmt* for more information.
