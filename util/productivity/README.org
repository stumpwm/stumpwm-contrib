** Commentary
There are those for whom simply using a window manager like StumpWM
is enough to force them to buckle down and work, mostly because
they don't know how to play around with it (due to a lack of
frills). However, there are also those who know how to move around
in StumpWM and who may find themselves falling into the same bad
habits as those who use "normal" WMs; that is, switching between
windows a lot and fiddling with random functions the WM has
available. This fixes that by temporarily disabling StumpWM.

Incidentally, I'm not positive, but I believe that this may be
StumpWM's first Minor Mode.

** Usage

Just add the following line to your .stumpwmrc file:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "productivity")
#+END_SRC
...and then bind `productivity-mode-toggle' to a key in your
=*top-map*=. I recommend =H-#= (Hyper-shift-3).

When you activate productivity-mode, you won't be able to access
any of your StumpWM keymaps. That's right--the window manager is
effectively disabled! If you try to leave the window, or display
the time, or go to another group, or control MPD, or switch frames,
or whatever, you will instead be presented with a curt reminder of
what you're supposed to be doing. To escape from this mode, just
hit the key you have =productivity-mode-toggle= bound to again.

Absolutely DO NOT start productivity-mode from your .stumpwmrc file
unless you (a) are absolutely *sure* you have
productivity-mode-toggle bound to a key already, (b) automatically
switch to a window capable of controlling StumpWM (i.e., Emacs or a
terminal) in your .stumpwmrc, (c) want to convince your friends
your computer is broken, or (d) are crazy.

** Configuration

The following can be customized. If no example is given, please see
the code.

=*productivity-keys*=: Any and all keys you have bound to the
    =*top-map*= and their associated commands.
ex:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (setf productivity::*productivity-keys*
          '(("H-t"   *root-map*)
            ("C-;"   *rat-map*)
            ("Print" "screenshot")))
#+END_SRC

=*productivity-start-message*=: What StumpWM should print when you
    start productivity-mode.

=*productivity-stop-message*=: What StumpWM should print when you
    stop productivity-mode

=*productivity-back-to-work-message*=: What StumpWM should print
    when you attempt to waste time (you lazy, lazy, um...lazy
    person).

** Tasks
*** TODO Implement these features
- [ ] Add an option to toggle the mode-line on and off.
- [ ] Add an option to display a notifier for this mode, when on,
      in the mode-line (a la Emacs' minor modes).
      - Perhaps this could be integrated into a "minor modes"
        package? (Just in case somebody insinuates that StumpWM
        doesn't have *everything*.)
- [ ] Add a timer feature (i.e., have it toggle itself at a given
      interval or hour, so you can have your work time and
      messing-around-on-the-computer time predetermined).
- [ ] Add an option to disable stumpish, slime and/or
      stumpwm-mode.el (choose your poison/s).
- [ ] Make it do your work for you.
      - Note to self: Finish this one first, then have it write the
        rest for you.
