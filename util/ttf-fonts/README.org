* ttf-fonts
  A LISP implementation of TTF font rendering.

  All fonts installed on your OS default fonts folder will be loaded by TTF-fonts.

  On Linux, *~/.local/share/fonts* are loaded too, by default.

  Once new fonts are installed, you'll need to cache all fonts again.

  More info on *clx-truetype* README file.
