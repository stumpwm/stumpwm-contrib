* Requirements

- netcat
- port 22222 available.

* Usage

Put the following in your =~/.stumpwmrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "pinentry")
#+END_SRC

And set the following in your =~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf=:

#+BEGIN_SRC
pinentry-program /absolute/path/to/stumpwm-contrib/util/pinentry/stumpwm-pinentry
#+END_SRC

GnuPG Agent will now use StumpWM to ask for your password.

* Roadmap

- Better error management (pinentry protocol has a SETERROR command,
  cancelling the prompt has undefined behavior)
- Randomized port (or configurable)
