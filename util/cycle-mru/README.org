* Cycle MRU

Cycle windows in most recently used order.

** Description

Flip through a group's windows, in a fashion similar to Window's Alt-Tab or
macOS' Command-Tab. A.K.A. Most Recently Used order.

This code was lifted from [[http://nongnu.13855.n7.nabble.com/Alt-Tab-td127943.html][this thread]] on the stumpwm-devel mailing list from way
back in 2012.

I have made some minor aesthetic and semantic changes to it (ie - changing the
name from alt-tab to cycle-mru), but full credit goes to Ruthard Baudach for the
code.

I am a complete noob when it comes to lisp, so any improvements would be greatly
appreciated, as would any tips on how to implement the stuff on the todo list
below.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(load-module "cycle-mru")
(define-key *top-map* (kbd "M-Tab") "cycle-mru")
#+END_SRC

** Todo

- Use windowlist to choose, and only select on release.
- Implement reverse cycle.
- Preserve tab list during group change.
