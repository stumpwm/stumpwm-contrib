** Usage

Put the following in your =~/.stumpwmrc=:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "pass")
#+END_SRC

The following commands will become available:

- =pass-copy=: select an entry to put into the
  clipboard. (Auto-completion is available.)
- =pass-copy-menu=: select an entry from a menu to put into the
  clipboard.
- =pass-generate=: generate a password for a new given entry and put
  it into the clipboard.

There is no command to edit existing entries or to save a new entry
because the UI would be awkward at best.

The =pass:*password-store*= variable defines the home directory,
=#P"~/.password-store/"= by default.
