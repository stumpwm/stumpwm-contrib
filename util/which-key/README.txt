This module enables functionality similar to `which-key-mode` in
emacs.  When a keymap is enabled by pressing a key, a list of possible
keysequences are shown to the user, similar to the help menu (`C-t ?`)
For example, if I press `C-t` the commands in the root-map are shown
side-by-side with the keybindings. If I then press `g`, I am shown
the group root map is shown with its keybindings. This has been
very helpful while learning to use StumpWM!

TODO: Pop-up help menu only after a specified time has passed (~1 second)
