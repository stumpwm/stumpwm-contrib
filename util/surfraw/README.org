** Commentary

I like [[https://gitlab.com/surfraw/Surfraw][surfraw]]. If you're
reading this, you probably like surfraw. I've got surfraw-related
code in my .stumpwmrc, and (judging from some judicious googling
for RC files early on in my use of stumpwm) I know that I'm not the
only one. So it seemed like a good idea to just put that code in
a library.

** Usage

Just add the following line to your =.stumpwmrc= file:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load-module "surfraw")
#+END_SRC

...and then either call the functions here with "colon" (C-t ;) or
bind them to a key. I figure other people will probably have
different key preferences than I have, so I leave them entirely up
to you.

If you want to use the bookmark functions, don't forget to tell
stumpwm where your =*surfraw-bookmark-file*= is.

Note that there are also "=surfraw-selection=" variants on each
command that work on the X selection.
