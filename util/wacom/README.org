#+TITLE: Wacom StumpWM

* Requirements

- [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/xsetwacom][xsetwacom]]
- [[https://linuxwacom.github.io/][Linux Wacom Project]]

* Installation

Like any other module: Add ~(load-module "wacom")~ somewhere in your ~.stumpwmrc~.

* Usage

Focus the frame you want to use your wacom tablet. Run ~map-wacom-to-current-frame~.

One thing that can't be detected is the physical orientation of your device. Even if we could detect landscape/portrait mode, we can't know which way is right-side-up.

** Parameters

There are a couple of parameters defined in ~wacom.lisp~ that you can edit to match the layout of your
tablet on your desk.

#+begin_src lisp
(defparameter *portrait-rotate* "ccw"
  "If you notice the directions are the reverse of what you desirte when your
   frame is in portrait orientation, then change this parameter to 'cw'.")

(defparameter *landscape-rotate* "half"
  "If you notice directions are the reverse of what you desire when your
   frame is in landscape orientation, then change this parameter to 'none'.")
#+end_src
